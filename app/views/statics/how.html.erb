    <h1>How it works ?</h1>

    <h2>How to read our notation ?</h2>
    <p>A cursor placed more to the left will indicate that the film is below what we can generally see in films of the same categories recently released. But that doesn't mean the movie will be bad for you !</p>
    <p>A cursor placed rather to the right will indicate that the film is perhaps better in quality, innovation or risk taking choices. But that doesn't mean the movie will be good for you !</p>
    <p>A cursor placed rather in the center will indicate to you that the film is similar to others in the same categories recently released. This usually means that the film does not stand out. Neither good nor bad. Maybe a little bland. It's up to you !</p>

    <h1>The Whole Concept</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>How to find a good movie ?</h2>
    <p>Before seeing a film, part of the audience will rely on its popularity, criticism or rating.</p>
    <h2>Should movies be rated ?</h2>
    <p>Or rather what should the note look like? Current rating systems are not suitable for movies and in few minutes you will be convinced.</p>
    <p>Cinema and VOD services are industry products. Are the most watched movies the best? Overall, the mass distribution mechanisms will market and influence the choice of viewers. This choice goes beyond artistic analysis and this consumer reality is what keeps the film industry alive. Whether we like it or not.</p>
    <p>The choice between two films with similar posters must be able to be made quickly on neutral criteria without being deprived of all their qualities. This is why the rating or the criticism is essential for the spectators. The criticism is based on the individuality of the wearer and is also appreciated when one has seen the film in question.</p>
    <p>The note requires a certain neutrality. By nature, it is an assessment tool aimed at objectivity of assessment and some spectators expect clear and pragmatic indicators. Either because they don't want to spend too much time educating themselves, or because they just think that finding a movie is theirs.</p>
    <p>Current ratings are immediate value judgments. Apart from the qualitative analysis of a film is too complex to simply judge whether a film is good or not. Only an analytical critique can position itself on a judgment and yet it remains impossible to subject all viewers to the same objectivity, the same tastes, the same emotions.</p>
    <h2>The relative notation is a solution</h2>
    <p>Our solution, a new rating on a relative scale to avoid connotations of good or bad.</p>
    <p>For each rating criterion, a scale with a cursor which indicates according to its position if the film offers an average work of films released in recent years and that we call the standard. We wish to inform the spectator of if a film shows more accentuated work than the average or if, on the contrary, it is behind on a criterion. For NotaCine, doing less is not pejorative.</p>
    <p>The Revenant with Leonardo Dicaprio has an underdeveloped storyline in the face of the norm but actually more in his footage. Martin Scorsese's The Departed has a complex and elaborate script but differs little from the norm by its images. We do not judge the quality but the care taken on a criterion in view of all the recent films. So you will no longer choose a movie because it's good, but because rare work has been done on it. Passing a negative judgment on a work might deter a viewer who would have liked it and we don't want that.</p>
