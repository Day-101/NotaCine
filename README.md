# > Welcome to **NotaCine**, a new way to rate movies

 >When reviewing movies, ratings are something that you should take pretty seriously. However, we think that the regular way of using a number to rate a movie is biased. That is why we came up with **NotaCine**, a website that is unlike the hundreds of other services reviewing movies.

 ### > The Idea
 
 The idea is simple: Rather than giving arbitrary notations, the reviewer will compare six points with the industry standards:
 * **Scenario:** the quality of the story.
 * **Image:** the visuals, including special effects.
 * **Editing:** the quality of the cuts and the sequencing of the scenes.
 * **Sound and Soundtrack:** sound in general: effects, mastering and soundtrack
 * **Costumes, Makeup and Hair:** actor's makeup, hair styling and every costume that is not a visual effet
 * **Directing:** how the actors have been directed in that movie

# >The whole concept
### > How to find a good movie?

Before seeing a film, part of the audience will rely on its popularity, criticism or rating.

### > Should movies be rated?

Or rather what should the rate look like? Current rating systems are not suitable for movies anymore, here's why:

Cinema and VOD services are industry products. Are the most watched movies the best? Overall, the mass distribution mechanisms will influence the choice of the viewers. This choice goes beyond artistic analysis and this is what keeps the film industry alive. Whether we like it or not.

### > The choice problem

A fast choice between two movies, based on neutral criterias without any spoils of their qualities should be possible. And that's why reviews are essentials for the spectators. Our system of notation is compatible with the 'traditional' reviews, and we think that a good, thorough review can (and should) be enjoyed when a movie has already been seen.

Even if they often are great, thorough movie reviews aren't really a great way to discover films. The main reasons are that they often are pretty lengthy and also that theses reviews may remove that "discovering" part of a movie.
### > The relative notation is a solution

Our way of rating movies might be the solution to the current notation system. Because the qualitative analysis is often too extensive to tell if a movie is good or not, and even the idea of a good or a bad movie is really abstract. Because all viewers have different feelings about a movie and globally unique tastes. Because of that, we made NotaCine. A new, different way to rate movies.

*The Revenant* with Leonardo Dicaprio has an underdeveloped storyline (when comparing it with the norm) but actually provides better visuals. *The Departed* by Martin Scorsese has a complex and elaborate script but its imagery does not stand out from the norm. We do not judge the quality but the care taken on a criterion **relative** to recent films. Therefore, you will no longer choose a movie because it's good, but because some particular care has been taken on some points. Expressing a negative judgment on a work might deter a viewer who would have liked it, and we don't want that.
