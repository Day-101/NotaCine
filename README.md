# > Welcome to **NotaCine**, a new way to rate movies

 >When reviewing movies, ratings are something that you should take pretty seriously. However, we think that the regular way of using a number to rate a movie is biased. That is why we came up with **NotaCine**, a website that is unlike the hundreds of other services reviewing movies.

 ### > The Idea
 
 The idea is simple: Rather than giving arbitrary notations, the reviewer will compare six points with the industry standards:
 * **Scenario:** the quality of the story.
 * **Image:** the visuals, including special effects.
 * **Editing:** the quality of the cuts and the sequencing of the scenes.
 * **Sound and Soundtrack:** sound in general: effects, mastering and soundtrack
 * **Makeup and Hair:** actor's makeup, hair styling and every costume that is not a visual effet
 * **Directing:** how the actors have been directed in that movie

### > The review system
-The review system might look weird at first, but it has been made this way to suit you better. You will soon be able to understand and use it to find your next favorite movie. 

-On a movie page, you will see a lot of cursors which will give you the average rating on the website for each one of them.

-Each slider will indicate, on this criterion, if the movie you're looking at is ahead (or behind) of the industryâ€™s standards.

-A bad review on one criterion doesn't mean that you will not like that movie.

-A great review, however, doesn't mean that you will like it either.

### > A few more things to say

* Find the one (or the few) criterias that matters the most to you, and filter the website to your taste through the search functionality.
* You can access your own profile to change your informations or profile picture, and you can also visit other's to see their past reviews. (Maybe you'll find some nice reviewers !)
